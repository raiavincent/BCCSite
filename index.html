    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Founded in the fall of 2021, Bushwick Chess Club has formed a community of players, new and experienced alike. The community has flourished with consistent club nights and tournaments, with an engaged community.<br>
        The club nights are consistently full, but that should not discourage new visitors. Rapid (10+0) and blitz (5+0) tournaments are held monthly as well, with cash prizes.<br>
        Bushwick Chess Club is thankful to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nook_bklyn/">Nook</a> for allowing us to use their space to grow our community and chess abilities. Beer, wine, coffee, etc. is available for purchase all night, please show your support to them.
